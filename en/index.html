          <p>
			Technological systems are becoming more complex through the increasing integration of knowledge and components from different disciplines. These often on-board systems cover a wide range of applications in different industrial fields such as aeronautics (flight control, more electric propulsion systems, etc.), automotive (hybrid, electric vehicles, steering actuators), space (space mechanisms) and robotics. The development of new means of mobility, such as drones, autonomous vehicles, land or air electric mobility, intensifies these needs in preliminary design. 
			</br></br>
			The objectives of the GIS SizingLab are to promote reflection, development and training around :
			<ul class="listp">
			  <li>The use and development of design methods and associated open source software tools that can be generically applied to the conceptual synthesis of physical entities and multidisciplinary power transmissions of technological systems.</li>
			  <li>The generation and capitalization of the necessary models that can come from different disciplines and different levels of representation.</li>
			  <li>The implementation of case studies using these methods and models to promote knowledge transfer and exchange, identify needs, generate feedback.</li>
			</ul>
